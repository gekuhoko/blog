/*
    why this project?
        I want to build a system that allows free creators build a following

            OWN FOLLOWERS DATA
                We need a separate system because you want to own your followings contacts, namely
                    -> name
                    -> deviceID
                    -> email
                    -> phone
                If you just build a following on YT or IG or FB you get squeezed over time

            CROSS PLATFORM BI
                    -> check how fast you grow
                    -> check growth drivers (platforms, topics)

            HAVE CROSS PLATFORM DISTRIBUTION
                It's like a pimped Wordpress but also has integration with IG, YT, Podcast


    I need that system to build networking-equity.
    This system is useful for friends as well
